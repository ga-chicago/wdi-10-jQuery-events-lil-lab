# Random Imager

In `student_labs` make a directory `random_imager`. Add your files to `random_imager`

* index.html
* app.js
* style.css

Add jQuery.

* Using jQuery, make a square div with the text "Add random image". Add a class to make the div square (100 x 100). Give it some color.

* The div should have `cursor: pointer` in its CSS, so that when the user hovers the cursor over the div, the cursor turns into a pointer thing.

* Make an array of six image urls in your js file. (strings)

* Make it so that when you click the "Add random image" div, one random image from your array will appear on the page.

* Make it so that each image is re-sized to the same proportions as the square div (100 x 100). Or, you could use Google images -> Tools -> Size to source images at the size you want.

* Make it so the images are added horizontally.



## RESEARCH...

* Make it so that when you click on one of the added images, it will be removed from the page.

* Each added image can run the same function to achieve this goal.

## EXTRA STUFF


We can run any procedure we like we like with our clicks:

**From previous labs:**

* Construct a horrible digital quilt
* Construct a pyramid made from triangles

1. EXTRA RESEARCH CHALLENGE: Add an input box and a button to your labs. When the button is clicked, grab the value of the text inside the input box, and use that value as an argument in your `generateCheckerBoard(NUM)` and `generatePyramid(NUM)` functions.

2. Finish the **Virtual Rolodex** stuff if you haven't done so. Classes aren't going away. You could adapt Virtual Rolodex to make each person a `Person` and you could make your rolodex a `Rolodex` and they could both be classes or maybe it would be better if the `Person`s were a class and you could have the Rolodex still be an object and it could store `Person`s in some kind of data structure inside of itself,
